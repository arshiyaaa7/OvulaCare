# OvulaCare 🌸 — Your AI Companion for PCOS & Women's Wellness

---

## 💡 Why OvulaCare?

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is not just a hormonal condition — it’s an emotional and physical journey that many women silently endure. From irregular cycles, mood swings, weight changes, to the anxiety of not being understood — PCOS affects day-to-day life deeply. Most women face it alone, without consistent emotional support or tools to track what they’re going through.

**OvulaCare** was created from empathy — a space that listens, learns, and supports. It’s more than just a tracker. It’s a companion. A friend. A guide. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, confused, or just want to understand your symptoms better, OvulaCare is here for you.
